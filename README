Usage
=====

Quby is a Rails 3.1 Mountable Engine, which means that you have to mount it
into your existing Rails application. First, you need to include Quby as a gem in your Gemfile:

    gem 'quby', :git => "git@github.com:roqua/quby.git"

Then, mount it at a path in your application. You can do this by putting a line
in config/routes.rb. Note that "/quby" could be anything you want.

    mount Quby::Engine => "/quby", :as => "quby_engine"

In config/initializers/quby.rb, you need to tell Quby where it can find its questionnaire definitions.

    Quby.questionnaires_path = "db/questionnaires"
    Quby.functions_path      = "db/functions"

Questionnaires
==============

The questionnaires from the RGOc are stored in a seperate git repository:

    git@github.com:roqua/questionnaires.git
